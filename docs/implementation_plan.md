## Technical Architecture

### Frontend (C)
```
Source Code → Lexer → Parser → AST → Type Checker → High IR
```

### Middle End
```
High IR → Ownership Analysis → Region Inference → Mid IR → Optimizations → Low IR
```

### Backend
```
Low IR → LLVM IR → Native Code
```

### Verification
```
Formal Semantics (Coq) → Mechanized Proofs → Correctness Guarantees
```

## Key Implementation Details

### Ownership System
- **Unique ownership** (`!T`) with move semantics
- **Immutable borrowing** (`&'r T`) with lifetime tracking
- **Mutable borrowing** (`&'r mut T`) with exclusive access
- **Region polymorphism** for lifetime-parameterized functions

### Type System
- **Hindley-Milner inference** with ownership extensions
- **Higher-kinded types** for generic programming
- **Effect types** for resource tracking
- **Linear types** for resource management

### Concurrency Model
- **Actor-based** message passing
- **Session types** for protocol verification
- **Linear capabilities** for channel communication
- **No shared mutable state**

### Memory Management
- **Region-based allocation** with deterministic deallocation
- **Stack allocation** for short-lived values
- **Arena allocation** for bulk operations
- **No garbage collection** - explicit resource management

## Research Questions

1. **Can we extend ownership types to support safe concurrent programming while maintaining ergonomics?**

2. **How can we verify compiler optimizations while maintaining performance?**

3. **What is the expressiveness vs. safety trade-off in resource-aware type systems?**

4. **How effective are ML-guided optimizations compared to classical heuristics?**

## Timeline

- **Months 1-3**: Foundation and basic type system
- **Months 4-6**: IR design and LLVM integration
- **Months 7-9**: Verification framework and proofs
- **Months 10-12**: Advanced features and optimization
- **Months 13-15**: Tooling and empirical evaluation
- **Months 16-18**: Paper writing and thesis preparation

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Verification complexity**: Start with core calculus, use translation validation
- **Performance gaps**: Target niche wins, use LLVM for baseline
- **Feature creep**: Focus on 2-3 core contributions

### Research Risks
- **Novelty requirements**: Combine existing techniques in new ways
- **Evaluation challenges**: Use standard benchmarks and real applications
- **Publication timeline**: Plan incremental results and conference submissions

## Next Steps

1. Complete parser implementation
2. Implement basic type checker
3. Design multi-level IR
4. Set up verification framework
5. Begin empirical evaluation

This implementation plan provides a roadmap for building A# as a production-quality research language with formal verification and novel ownership features.
